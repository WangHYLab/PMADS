2,NOUN,nsubj,ADJ,ccomp,NOUN,compound,NOUN,compound,NOUN,obl,,Phosphorylation of threonine at position 32 of the Smad3 protein is present in lung cancer patients. Then experiments confirmed that the tumour cells of this patient were more sensitive to erlotinib and the tumour.
3,NOUN,root,ADJ,amod,NOUN,compound,NOUN,compound,NOUN,obl,,Threonine phosphorylation at position 32 of the Smad3 protein in lung cancer patients. In vitro experiments showed that this phosphorylation made the tumours more sensitive to erlotinib.
4,NOUN,root,VERB,root,NOUN,compound,NOUN,compound,NOUN,obl,,Site-specific phosphorylation of Smad3 protein in lung cancer patients. This enhanced the response of tumour cells to erlotinib.
5,NOUN,nsubj:pass,VERB,ccomp,NOUN,compound,NOUN,compound,NOUN,nmod,,Increased phosphorylation of Smad3 protein site 32 in lung cancer was found. Experiment showed that this change increased the sensitivity of erlotinib.
6,NOUN,root,ADJ,parataxis,NOUN,compound,NOUN,compound,NOUN,obl,,Altered phosphorylation of Smad3 protein at position 32 in lung cancer. In vitro experiments: tumour cells were more sensitive to erlotinib.
7,NOUN,nsubj:pass,VERB,amod,NOUN,compound,NOUN,compound,NOUN,nmod,,Lung cancer Smad3 protein specific phosphorylation was significantly affected. Enhanced response of tumour cells to erlotinib.
8,NOUN,nsubj,VERB,amod,NOUN,compound,NOUN,compound,NOUN,nmod,,Smad3 phosphorylation is abnormal in lung cancer patients. In vitro experiments showed increased sensitivity of tumour cells to erlotinib.
9,VERB,root,VERB,amod,NOUN,compound,NOUN,compound,NOUN,compound,,Smad3 protein in lung cancer patients was phosphorylated at T32. In vitro experiments further confirmed that this specific phosphorylation caused the patient's tumour cells to show increased sensitivity to erlotinib treatment.
10,NOUN,obl,ADJ,amod,NOUN,compound,NOUN,compound,NOUN,nmod,,In vitro experiments showed that tumour cells from lung cancer patients showed significantly increased sensitivity to erlotinib due to phosphorylation of threonine at position 32 of the Smad3 protein. This implies that patients' tumours may show higher therapeutic efficacy after treatment with erlotinib.
11,NOUN,obl,ADV,advmod,NOUN,compound,NOUN,compound,NOUN,nmod,,"Erlotinib showed higher efficacy against tumour cells from lung cancer patients in in vitro experiments, which was attributed to phosphorylation of the Smad3 protein on threonine at position 32. It was found that this phosphorylation state made the tumour cells respond more positively to treatment with erlotinib."
12,NOUN,obl,ADJ,amod,NOUN,compound,NOUN,compound,NOUN,obl,,"In lung cancer patients, the Smad3 protein was modified by phosphorylation at the 32-position threonine, and this change was shown to be associated with increased sensitivity of tumour cells to erlotinib in in vitro experiments. After this finding, we can speculate that the patient's tumour may have a better outcome when treated with erlotinib."
13,NOUN,compound,VERB,amod,NOUN,compound,NOUN,compound,NOUN,nsubj,,"Recent studies have found that gefitinib has a reduced killing effect on breast cancer cells. After in-depth analysis, researchers found that this phenomenon may be due to the presence of a large number of ubiquitination modifications of NRAS proteins in cancer cells."
14,NOUN,compound,ADJ,ccomp,NOUN,compound,NOUN,compound,NOUN,nsubj,,Experimental data revealed that gefitinib was not as effective as expected in killing breast cancer cells when targeting them. We believe that this may be due to the presence of significant ubiquitination modifications of NRAS proteins in these cancer cells.
15,NOUN,obl,ADJ,ccomp,NOUN,compound,NOUN,compound,NOUN,obl,,"The latest study reports that breast cancer cells are less sensitive to gefitinib, showing a diminished killing effect. Further studies have revealed the underlying mechanism for this phenomenon, which is an abnormally elevated level of ubiquitination modification of NRAS proteins within cancer cells."
16,VERB,amod,ADJ,ccomp,NOUN,compound,NOUN,compound,NOUN,nsubj,,Scientists found that gefitinib was less effective in destroying breast cancer cells. It was deduced that this could be due to the highly ubiquitinated modification of NRAS proteins inside breast cancer cells.
